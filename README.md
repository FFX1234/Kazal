This planet pack replaces the stock kerbal system with a custom made star system orbiting a red dwarf called Kazal.

From a hot hellish super-Kerbin, a massive Jool like planet with a gigantic ring, to a icy moon with methane ocean, this mod has a resonable amount of variabilty and originality.

You start on a large-ish habitable super-kerbin in a eccentric orbit around a Neidon massed jovian planet with a small system of moons.
